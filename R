Hi,

We created this program for the Bonus Question

OS: Mac OS Ventura

Assignment - Bits Pilani Group 25 Data Structure

Well, this program doesn't include any dependencies but a c compiler is must to run this.. We think to create this program on top of Docker, but we just think it would be overkill, so we skip that plan


# Sorted Array Merger Program

This is a C program that takes a list of non-empty sorted arrays of integers and merges them into a single sorted array. It provides a responsive user interface, handles errors gracefully, and efficiently merges and sorts the input data.

## Features

- Merges multiple sorted arrays into one.
- Accepts user input for array sizes and elements.
- Handles invalid input and memory allocation errors.
- Provides a sorted merged array as output.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program**: Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).

   ```bash
   gcc sorted_array_merger.c -o sorted_array_merger
